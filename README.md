# Machine Learning: Binary Classification Model 

# Project Statement 

This is the concluding part of the Hamoye Stage C Capstone Project

Here, I tried to make a comprehensive analysis to the problem we tried in Hamoye Stage 
C assessment. I took a step further to visualize what was not done in Stage C assessment
as it had some limited instructions.

The Project as a whole seeks to build a BINARY CLASSIFICATION MODEL that predicts if
a grid is stable or stable

Different algorithms were built to accommodate different accuracy and also performances
